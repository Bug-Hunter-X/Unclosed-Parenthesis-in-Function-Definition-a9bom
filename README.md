This repository demonstrates a common Python error: an unclosed parenthesis in a function definition. The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.py` provides the corrected version.  The error results in a `SyntaxError` during compilation. This example highlights the importance of careful code syntax.
